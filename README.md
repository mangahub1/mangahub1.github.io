# MangaHub Prototype

1) Put one or more PDF files into `/pdfs/` (replace `/pdfs/sample.pdf` with a real file).
2) Start a local server from this folder:
   `python -m http.server 5173`
3) Open:
   `http://localhost:5173`
4) For GitHub Pages, keep all paths relative (already set up this way).

Notes:
- `sample.pdf` is only a placeholder in this prototype.
- App loads `./pdfs/sample.pdf` by default.
